Underscore is a "kitchen sink" library for Node and browsers that provides convenience functions for working with arrays, objects, and functions. It brings many of [Ruby's beloved Enumerable functions](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html) to Javscript arrays, albeit in a slightly less glamorous way. Underscore also provides helpers for function binding, javascript templating, deep equality testing, and so on. It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map, reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.
