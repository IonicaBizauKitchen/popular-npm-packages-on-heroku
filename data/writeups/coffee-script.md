The [Coffeescript website](http://coffeescript.org/) explains it well:

> CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.

Proponents of Coffeescript prefer its human-friendly style reminiscent of Ruby or Python, and for the features it offers that aren't available in vanilla JavaScript like [multi-line strings](http://coffeescript.org/#strings),  [classes](http://coffeescript.org/#classes), and convenient [function binding](http://coffeescript.org/#fat-arrow).

Opponents of Coffeescript generally dislike the added mental overhead of switching between JavaScript and Coffeescript when working on projects that use both. Using Coffeescript in a project often increases the complexity of the development environment and build process, as the code must be transpiled to JavaScript. Writing npm mobuldes in Coffeescript may also decrease the likelihood of contributions from the open-source community, as many would-be contributors are turned off by the language.

The beauty of open-source development is that developers and teams can choose the tools that work for them. Hooray for language diversity.
