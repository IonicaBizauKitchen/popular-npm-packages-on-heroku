Stylus is a language that compiles to CSS. Like Sass and SCSS, Stylus supports both an indented syntax and regular CSS style. Stylus takes the minimalism of Sass a step further by eschewing all superfluous syntax, such as colons between properties and values in declarations. Stylus supports many of the features like variables and mixins that designers have come to expect from a CSS preprocessor, but it has many other powerful features too, like [functions](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/functions.html), [keywords arguments](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/kwargs.html), and the [@extend directive](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/extend.html).
