Request is a simplified HTTP request client. While it's perfectly reasonable to use [Node's built-in HTTP client](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html), it's often desirable to use a more high-level interface for making HTTP requests. Request is one among many packages, and is incredible feature-rich. Request has first-class support for [streaming](https://github.com/mikeal/request#streaming), [forms](https://github.com/mikeal/request#forms), [authentication](https://github.com/mikeal/request#http-authentication), [OAuth signing](https://github.com/mikeal/request#http-authentication), and more.
