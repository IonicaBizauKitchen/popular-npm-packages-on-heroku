mongodb is the officially supported Node driver for MongoDB. In Spring 2012, MongoDB officially adopted the popular Node MongoDB Native Project and sponsored the maintainer, Christian Kvalheim, to continue its development. It is written in pure JavaScript and provides a native asynchronous Node.js interface to MongoDB. The driver is optimized for simplicity. It can be used on its own, but it also serves as the basis of several object mapping libraries, such as Mongoose.
