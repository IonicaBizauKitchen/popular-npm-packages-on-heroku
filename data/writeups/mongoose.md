Mongoose is an object document mapper (ODM) for MongoDB. It was created way back in 2010 during the early days of Node, and was one of the first popular Node libraries that simplified the process of modelling data in a backend datastore. Mongoose provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to modeling your application data and includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more.
