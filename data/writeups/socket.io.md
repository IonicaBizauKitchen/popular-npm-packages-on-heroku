Socket.IO was an early contender in the Node Websockets space, and one of the first projects to attempt to fully encapsulate all of the concerns when building socket-based applications. Socket.IO's [namespaces feature](http://socket.io/docs/rooms-and-namespaces/) provides a way to minimize the number of TCP connections while separating concerns within your application by introducing separation between communication channels. After three years in development, version 1.0 was recently released along with [a new website](http://socket.io/).
