logfmt is a logging format [used inside Heroku](https://brandur.org/logfmt) that is optimal for easy development, consistency, and good legibility for humans and computers. At its core, logfmt is just a basic way of displaying key/value pairs in such a way that its output is fairly easily readable by a human or a computer, while at the same time not being absolutely optimal for either. There are logfmt utilities available in many languages, including Go, Ruby, Python, Node, and Clojure. The Node logfmt package can be used as [middleware for Express or Restify](https://github.com/csquared/node-logfmt#expressrestify-parsing-middleware).
