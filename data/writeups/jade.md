Jade is a template language inspired by Ruby's HAML. It has a clean, whitespace-sensitive syntax that is easy to read and maintain. Jade has support for many of the features you'd expect in a template language, like [conditionals](http://jade-lang.com/reference/conditionals/), [iteration](http://jade-lang.com/reference/iteration/), and [mixins](http://jade-lang.com/reference/mixins/).
