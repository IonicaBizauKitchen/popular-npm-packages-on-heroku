Express is far and away the most popular npm package to date, and the de facto standard for building server-side applications with Node. Its middleware system, inspired by Ruby's [Rack](http://rack.github.io/), makes it very flexible. Express originally derived its middleware functionality from the [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect#readme) framework, but with the release of Express 4, Connect is no longer a dependency. A collection of community-maintained middleware for Express 4 is available in the [expressjs organization](https://github.com/expressjs) on GitHub.
